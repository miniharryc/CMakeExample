# CMake Tutorial


This is a worked example of the CMake tutorial found [here].

Currently, it's working up through step 4.

## Running

 1. Clone the repo
 2. cd into the directory
 3. run `cmake .`
 4. run `make test`
 5. run `make install` (if you'd like to install the binary.)

## TODO

 - Add git tags to that you can go forward/backward through steps
   and follow along.
